Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Aut,<span class="imp">error</span> . Consequatur, numquam? Blanditiis quod earum iste tempore debitis repellat aliquid quidem voluptate ducimus,<span class="imp">pariatur laboriosam natus commodi minima eos? Mollitia</span>?
</div><br>

11. Inline vs Block Elements:
o Create a web page demonstrating the difference between inline and block-level 
elements. Include examples such as <span> and <div>.
    <p>The difference between Inline and Block-level elements.
        Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are typically used for smaller chunks of content within a block-level element.
        Behavior: They do not force a line break and can have other inline elements within them.
        some examples are <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;span&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;image&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.
            <br>

            Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (by default). They are used for larger sections of content.
Behavior: They always start on a new line and can contain other block-level or inline elements.
some examples are: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>.
    <br>   
    </p><br>

12. Links within the Same Page:
o Create links that navigate to different sections of the same web page using the 
anchor links.<br><br>
<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a><br>
<a href="#section 2">Go to section 2</a><br>
<a href="#section 3">Go to section 3</a><br>

13. HTML Entities:
o Use HTML entities to display special characters such as &,<, >, ", and Â© on a 
web page.<br>
<div>
<p>ampersand=&amp;</p>
<p>less than sign=&lt; </p>
<p>Greater than sign= &gt;</p>
<p> double quotation mark=&quot;</p>
<p>copyright symbol= &copy;</p>
</div>

14. Forms with Different Input Types:
o Create a form that includes different types of inputs: text, password, email, 
number, and date. Label each input field appropriately.
<h2> A form</h2>
<label for="cloud">Place:</label>
    <input id="cloud" type="text" placeholder="Your favorite place"><br>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="njsw@764gmail.com" ><br>

        <input type="date" id="date" placeholder="date/month/year"><br>

        <input type="submit" value="Submit"><br>

15. Form Validation:
o Add basic form validation using HTML attributes such as required, minlength, 
maxlength, min, max, and pattern.<br>

<label for="email">Email:</label><br>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="hswg@865gmail.com" required 
               minlength="5" maxlength="50"><br>

               <label for="number">Number (1-50):</label><br>
        <input type="number" id="number" name="number" required 
               min="1" max="50"><br><br>

               <label for="username">Username (letters and numbers only, 5-15 characters):</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required 
               minlength="5" maxlength="15" pattern="[A-Za-z0-9]+"><br><br>

               <input type="submit" value="Submit"><br>
